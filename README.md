# OpenCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.

# Numpy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
1. a powerful N-dimensional array object
2. sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
3. tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
4. useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
